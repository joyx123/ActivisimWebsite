      <p class="flex-item">  The Ogallala Aquifer is a vast underground reservoir of freshwater that covers the central region of the U.S. The aquifer is being depleted at alarming rates with withdrawal quintupling between 1949 and 1974. The water from the Ogallala Aquifer supplies drinking water to residents of the High Plains area and agriculture in the region. <br><br>
  Once completely dry, it will take 6000 years to refill naturally again and $20 billion worth of food and fiber that the aquifer supported will be lost. Studies have projected that 70% of the Ogallala Aquiferâ€™s water will be depleted in the next 50 years.<br><br>For more info, take a look at these helpful resources! <br><br><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ogallala-aquifer/">The Ogallala Aquifer: Saving a Vital U.S. Water Source</a><br><br><a href="https://www.myhighplains.com/water-and-drought-on-the-high-plains/the-ogallala-aquifer-when-will-the-wells-run-dry-what-then/">The Ogallala Aquifer: When will the wells run dry?

        </div><br>
        <p>The Aral Sea, located between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, has almost completely dried up, shrinking to less than 10% of its size fifty years ago. Pollution, salinization, and excessive irrigation has made the water undrinkable and the once-flourishing fishing industry collapse. <br><br>
  Locals in the area are suffering from health issues from drinking the contaminated water. Although there have been efforts to revive the sea, it is generally agreed that the sea will never be fully restored. It is estimated that the Aral Sea will completely disappear in 20 years.<br><br>For more info, take a look at these helpful resources! <br><br><a href="(https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2017/10/global-helse/vanishing-aral-sea-health-consequences-environmental-disaster">The vanishing Aral Sea: health consequences of an environmental disaster</a><br><br><a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/environment/aral-sea-disaster-why-one-of-the-biggest-inland-seas-dried-up/">Aral Sea Disaster: Why One of the Biggest Inland Seas Dried Up?</a></p>
